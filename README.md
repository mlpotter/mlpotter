<!-- Talking about you -->
I am a Ph.D. student interested in Bayesian statistics, Bayesian neural networks robotics, deep learning , machine learning, and tracking algorithms advised by [Prof. Deniz Erdogmus](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/erdogmus-deniz/) and co-advised by [Prof. Michael Everett](https://mfe7.github.io/) at Northeastern University (NU). I previously earned an M.S. from UCLA and both an M.S. and B.S. from Northeastern University.


My main expertise has revolved around :
1) Bayesian Statistics
2) Survival Analysis
3) Recommendation Systems
4) Low Dimensional Dynamic Embeddings

- 👨🏽‍💻 I’m currently working on my PhD at Northeastern University;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NeRF, Real Analysis, Bayesian Neural Networks, and SLAM; 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research ideas 🤝 and I am always looking for research internships;
